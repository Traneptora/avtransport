     *
     * - <mode> is an optional setting which has different meanings for
     *   senders and receivers, and transports.
     *
     *   For senders, the default value, active means to start continuously sending
     *   packets to the given address. Passive means to wait for receivers to
     *   send packets on the given address to begin transmitting back to them.
     *
     *   For receivers, the default value, passive means to listen on the given
     *   address for any packets received. Active for receivers means that receivers
     *   will actively connect and try to request a stream from the target address.
     *
     * - <address> of the remote host, or local host, or multicast group
     *   May be suffixed with %<interface> to indicate an interface to attempt to bind to.
     *
     * - <port> on which to listen on/transmit to
     *
     * - <stream_id> of the stream(s) to present as default (overriding those
     *   signalled by the sender)
     *
     * - <setting1>=<value1> are a key=value pair of settings for the connection
     *
     * The library will also accept shorthand notations, such as "udp://",
     * "udplite://", "quic://" and "file://", but none may be followed by
     * <transport>:<mode>, only <address>[:<port>]. Using "avt://" is recommended.
